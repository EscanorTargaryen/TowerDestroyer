# TowerDestroyer
 AR Unity project (AR Fundation) for AR course in Loyola University (Sevilla)

## Background

This project was submitted as the final assignment for the Augmented Reality course at Loyola University (Seville). The course focused on the use of Unity and its application in AR scenarios, utilizing tools like Vuforia and AR Foundation. The course required regular submissions and practical exercises.


## Idea

The goal of the assignment was to deliver a functional AR application. I chose to create a simple mini-game where two factions clash.


## Gameplay

The first step is to identify a plane in space, after which a match can begin. The game map is structured as follows: a tower at the center of the plane and trees that gradually appear over time. The player must click on the trees to collect wood and then place spawners for their warriors. The warriors will start fighting enemy monsters and eventually destroy the tower. The objective is to defeat the enemy tower in the shortest time possible.
